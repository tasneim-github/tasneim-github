## About Me 🚀

I am a Muslim Computer Science student at UAEU with a strong interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
I’m currently building my foundation in programming and core computer science concepts, and I’m eager to apply these fundamentals as I continue my journey into AI and machine learning.

Outside of tech, I’m a dedicated Japanese language learner — and I’ve found that the process of learning a natural language has a lot in common with learning programming languages. I also enjoy creating art in my free time, and often find that creativity helps me approach coding and problem-solving with a different perspective.

I’m actively seeking opportunities to grow, collaborate, and apply what I’m learning in real-world environments — especially in AI-related projects or internships.

As a Muslim, I find inspiration in the value Islam places on seeking knowledge and using it for the benefit of others. That belief continues to guide my learning journey — encouraging me to grow not just as a developer, but as someone committed to meaningful impact.
